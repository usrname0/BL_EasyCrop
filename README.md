# BL Easy Crop

BL Easy Crop adds handles to a selected strip to change Blender's native crop paramaters from the Visual Sequence Editor / preview window.
With this extension crop looks and behaves a bit more like the other transforms: rotate, scale, move, transform.
It lives alongside the other transforms on the toolbar and has a keyboard shortcut "C".
After clicking the toolbar button you click on a strip to get your handles and start cropping.

1. Download the `BL_EasyCrop` zip
2. Open Blender and go to Edit → Preferences → Add-ons
3. Click "Install..." and select the downloaded folder

## Basic Cropping

1. Select a strip in the VSE
